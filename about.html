                   I added a drop down menu for the services tab, some more images and a table for the about page going over the changes made in the project.</p>

            <td><p>The final version of my project i tried to clean up and fix issues from the previos versions
                   such as some text and images not showing on screen. I added an imbedded map from google instead of an image
                   and also a form on the contacts page. Then I finally added the sub-menu pages for the services tab.
                   In the end I think the website could definately use improvment but overall I am pretty pleased with it.</p>
